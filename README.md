## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites or system requirements needed to run the project, such as Python version, libraries, or dependencies.

```bash
# Example:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

Provide installation instructions, including how to clone the repository and set up the project environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-consumption-prediction.git
