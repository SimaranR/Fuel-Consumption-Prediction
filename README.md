## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-consumption-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Train the model: Run the training script to build and train the fuel consumption prediction model.

2. Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or input samples.

3. Evaluate the model: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of historical fuel consumption records. You can find the dataset in the `data` directory. Ensure that you have the latest dataset or replace it with your data source for customized predictions.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `src/`: Houses the source code and scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `main.py`: The main script to execute the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the required dependencies for the project.
